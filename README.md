# FsVerbalExpressions

This library wraps the .NET RegEx object in a composable F# type and allows you to write regular expressions in natural language. Lazy evaluation ensures composition imposes no performance penalty.

- Documentation: [FsVerbalExpressions](http://verbalexpressions.github.io/FSharpVerbalExpressions/)
- Nuget: [FsVerbalExpressions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsVerbalExpressions "FsVerbalExpressions")

For enhanced debugging and API documentation experience, FsVerbalExpressions proudly implements [SourceLink](http://ctaggart.github.io/SourceLink/ "SourceLink")

## Future Directions

Expanding and enhancing the Verbal Expression language for F# is not currently a major focus, unless users request some specific use cases.

Enhancing the regular expression composition experience is currently the major focus. See:
- [Functions for static Regex methods](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/FSharpVerbalExpressions/issues/2 "Functions for static Regex methods")
- [MatchCollection, CaptureCollection, GroupCollection natively as arrays](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/FSharpVerbalExpressions/issues/3 "MatchCollection, CaptureCollection, GroupCollection natively as arrays")

Pull requests welcome so long as 

- they include excellent unit test coverage 
- they include correct intellisense documentation
- they adhere to the concepts of composability and Verbal Expressions

FsVerbalExpressions adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/ "Semantic Versioning"). So long as the project is pre-1.0.0 minor versions may be breaking. Once the project reaches 1.0.0 minor enhancements will be backwards-compatible.
